# How we built it
I worked to build my hackathon project, "LinkShelf‚Äù, built out frontend with React framework and backend with Express and NodeJS using MERN stack overall on top of OKE Kubernetes cluster and Mongo DB cluster which Oracle cloud provides. The job became easier as soon as Mongo DB standalone provisioned for my app smoothly and tightly. Finally, I was able to deploy the app to OKE cluster leveraging cloud shell and code editor.

# Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges faced during the development of the app was building a backend that could be deployed using Mongo DB.  Finding a built-in components for the app was difficult though.
How to configure our cluster for our Networking service
How to setup DB API for MongoDB 
How to setup deployments manifest
Overall I managed to find the ideas and build something that every one would find easy to navigate.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of how I started the hackathon with an idea and was able to see the majority of what I wanted to achieve come to amusing. I set out to create a platform that would make it easier for users to track and save video's links, and after some findings I was able to do just that!
Overall, we are proud to be making a positive change for a good social cause.

# What we learned
I had the opportunity to learn new technologies and tools, gain experiences expanded my technical skills and gave me the chance to work with mern stack and autonomous DB from oracle

# What's next for LinkShelf Management App
While I planned to implement the messaging feature using chatAPI, I was not able to do in terms of automating the chat bot for new users. However, I will try to identify and in the future, I plan to implement those missing features and enhance the UI to make it run smoother.
I also want to make the website more responsive towards any screen size to ensure every user can access it from any device.
